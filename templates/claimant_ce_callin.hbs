        <p>We are the office that makes disability decisions for the Social Security Administration.  It is very important that we speak to you about the special examination we arranged to evaluate your/{{clmt_full_name}}'s disability claim.</p>

        <p>{{prompt text "Enter text here"}}</p>

        <p>{{cannedText cannedText}}</p>


        <p>Please call the phone number(s) shown below {{org.openTime}} and {{org.closeTime}}.  When you call or leave a message, please provide the Case ID:  {{case.caseId}}, the individual's name, your name, and a call back number</p>

        <p>If you do not respond by {{clmt_ce_callin_response_date}}, we may decide the case based on the evidence we already have in file. This means that we could find that you/he/she are/is not disabaled based on our rules or that your/his/her disability has ended if you/he/she are/is already getting benefits.
