        <p>We are the office that makes disability decisions for the Social Security Administration.  On {{date_original_request}} we requested information from you about {{clmt_full_name}}'s case. To date, we have not received a response.</p>

        <p>We need to speak with you by {{clmt_callin_fu_response_date}}. Please call the phone number(s) shown below {{org.openTime}} and {{org.closeTime}}.  When you call or leave a message, please provide the Case ID:  {{case.caseId}}, the individual's name, your name, and a call back number</p>

        <p>If you do not respond by {{clmt_callin_fu_form_response_date}}, we may decide the case based on the evidence we already have in file. This means that we could find that you/he/she are/is not disabaled based on our rules or that your/his/her disability has ended if you/he/she are/is already getting benefits.
