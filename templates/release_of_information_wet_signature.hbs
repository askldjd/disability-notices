        <p>We are the office that makes disability decisions for the Social Security Administration.  We are writing to you because we need additional signed authorization form(s) to send to your/{{case.claimantInfo.name.firstName}} {{case.claimantInfo.name.middleName}} {{case.claimantInfo.name.lastName}}'s medical sources.</p>

        <p><strong>Who Should Sign The Form(s)</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li>If the claim is for an individual over age {{age_of_majority}}, the individual must sign the attached form(s). However, if the individual has a legal guardian, the legal guardian must sign the form(s).</li>
            <li>If the claim is for a child under age 12, the parent or legal guardian must sign the attached form(s), but not the child.</li>
            <li>If the claim is for a child between the ages of 12 and {{age_of_majority}}, both the child and the parent or legal guardian must sign the attached form(s).</li> 
        </ul>

        <p><strong>What You Need To Do</strong></p>

        <p>Please return the completed form(s) in the enclosed envelope by {{clmt_827_return_date}}. If you do not return the form(s), we may decide the case based on the information we already have in file. This means that we could find that you/he/she are/is not disabled based on our rules or that your/his/her disability has ended if you/he/she are/is already getting benefits.</p>

        <p><strong>If You Have Questions</strong></p>

        <p>If you have any questions, please contact us at the number(s) shown below {{org.openTime}} and {{org.closeTime}}.  When you call or leave a message, please provide the Case ID:  {{case.caseId}}, your name, his/her name, and a call back number.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your help.</p>
